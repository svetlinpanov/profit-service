# backoffice-react

This project is created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Development

Use `yarn start:<env>` to start a development server.

`<env>` must be either `dev`, `pre` or `pro`.

## Building for production

The backoffice is deployed automatically through the [CircleCI configuration](./.circleci/config.yml).

To build locally you can use `yarn build:<env>` similarly to the start command.
